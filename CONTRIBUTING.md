# How to contrubute

Thanks for considering on contributing to Kenzan's Git Do's and Don'ts. What started as a simple companion for a [CloudRI Meetup presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5eX5A98jGg) has now grown to be a set of tools that developers can leverage to become more comfortable using Git.

## Submitting Changes

Please create a Pull Request, targeting the `gh-pages` branch. This will ensure enhancements are applied directly to the Do's and Don'ts page. 

### Adding Do's and Don'ts

Currently, the list of Do's and Don'ts are containing within a JSON file, which is retrieved via the [`fetch()` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). Each item is stored in the order in which they appear on screen. New items should be appended to the end of the list.
